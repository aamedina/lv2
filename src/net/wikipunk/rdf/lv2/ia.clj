  "This extension defines a feature which allows plugin UIs to get a direct handle to an LV2 plugin instance (LV2_Handle), if possible.  Note that the use of this extension by UIs violates the important principle of UI/plugin separation, and is potentially a source of many problems. Accordingly, **use of this extension is highly discouraged**, and plugins should not expect hosts to support it, since it is often impossible to do so.  To support this feature the host must pass an LV2_Feature struct to the UI instantiate method with URI LV2_INSTANCE_ACCESS_URI and data pointed directly to the LV2_Handle of the plugin instance."
