  "This is a vocabulary for messages that access and manipulate properties. It can be used as a dynamic control interface for plugins, or anything else with a property-based model.  The key underlying concept here is to control things by manipulating arbitrary properties, rather than by calling application-specific methods. This allows implementations to understand what messages do (at least in a mechanical sense), which makes things like caching, proxying, or undo relatively straightforward to implement. Note, however, that this is only conceptual: there is no requirement to implement a general property store. Typically, a plugin will understand a fixed set of properties that represent its parameters or other internal state, and ignore everything else.  This protocol is syntax-agnostic, and [homoiconic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity) in the sense that the messages use the same format as the data they manipulate. In particular, messages can be serialised as a binary [Object](atom.html#Object) for realtime plugin control, or as Turtle for saving to a file, sending over a network, printing for debugging purposes, and so on.  This specification only defines a semantic protocol, there is no corresponding API. It can be used with the [Atom](atom.html) extension to control plugins which support message-based parameters as defined by the [Parameters](parameters.html) extension.  For example, if a plugin defines a `eg:volume` parameter, it can be controlled by the host by sending a patch:Set message to the plugin instance:      :::turtle     [         a patch:Set ;         patch:property eg:volume ;         patch:value 11.0 ;     ]  Similarly, the host could get the current value for this parameter by sending a patch:Get message:      :::turtle     [         a patch:Get ;         patch:property eg:volume ;     ]  The plugin would then respond with the same patch:Set message as above. In this case, the plugin instance is implicitly the patch:subject, but a specific subject can also be given for deeper control."
