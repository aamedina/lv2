  "LV2 is an interface for writing audio plugins in C or compatible languages, which can be dynamically loaded into many _host_ applications.  This core specification is simple and minimal, but is designed so that _extensions_ can be defined to add more advanced features, making it possible to implement nearly any feature.  LV2 maintains a strong distinction between code and data.  Plugin code is in a shared library, while data is in a companion data file written in [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/).  Code, data, and any other resources (such as waveforms) are shipped together in a bundle directory.  The code contains only the executable portions of the plugin.  All other data is provided in the data file(s).  This makes plugin data flexible and extensible, and allows the host to do everything but run the plugin without loading or executing any code.  Among other advantages, this makes hosts more robust (broken plugins can't crash a host during discovery) and allows generic tools written in any language to work with LV2 data.  The LV2 specification itself is distributed in a similar way.  An LV2 plugin library is suitable for dynamic loading (for example with `dlopen()`) and provides one or more plugin descriptors via `lv2_descriptor()` or `lv2_lib_descriptor()`.  These can be instantiated to create plugin instances, which can be run directly on data or connected together to perform advanced signal processing tasks.  Plugins communicate via _ports_, which can transmit any type of data.  Data is processed by first connecting each port to a buffer, then repeatedly calling the `run()` method to process blocks of data.  This core specification defines two types of port, equivalent to those in [LADSPA](http://www.ladspa.org/), lv2:ControlPort and lv2:AudioPort, as well as lv2:CVPort which has the same format as an audio port but is interpreted as non-audible control data.  Audio ports contain arrays with one `float` element per sample, allowing a block of audio to be processed in a single call to `run()`.  Control ports contain single `float` values, which are fixed and valid for the duration of the call to `run()`.  Thus the _control rate_ is determined by the block size, which is controlled by the host (and not necessarily constant).  ### Threading Rules  To facilitate use in multi-threaded programs, LV2 functions are partitioned into several threading classes:  | Discovery Class                  | Instantiation Class           | Audio Class                    | |----------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------- | | lv2_descriptor()                 | LV2_Descriptor::instantiate() | LV2_Descriptor::run()          | | lv2_lib_descriptor()             | LV2_Descriptor::cleanup()     | LV2_Descriptor::connect_port() | | LV2_Descriptor::extension_data() | LV2_Descriptor::activate()    |                                | |                                  | LV2_Descriptor::deactivate()  |                                |  Hosts MUST guarantee that:   * A function in any class is never called concurrently with another function    in that class.   * A _Discovery_ function is never called concurrently with any other function    in the same shared object file.   * An _Instantiation_ function for an instance is never called concurrently    with any other function for that instance.  Any simultaneous calls that are not explicitly forbidden by these rules are allowed. For example, a host may call `run()` for two different plugin instances simultaneously.  Plugin functions in any class MUST NOT manipulate any state which might affect other plugins or the host (beyond the contract of that function), for example by using non-reentrant global functions.  Extensions to this specification which add new functions MUST declare in which of these classes the functions belong, define new classes for them, or otherwise precisely describe their threading rules."

Hosts may present CV ports to users as controls in the same way as control ports.  Conceptually, aside from the buffer format, a CV port is the same as a control port, so hosts can use all the same properties and expectations.  In particular, this port type does not imply any range, unit, or meaning for its values.  However, if there is no inherent unit to the values, for example if the port is used to modulate some other value, then plugins SHOULD use a normalized range, either from -1.0 to 1.0, or from 0.0 to 1.0.  It is generally safe to connect an audio output to a CV input, but not vice-versa.  Hosts must take care to prevent data from a CVPort port from being used as audio."

Note that there is deliberately no major version: all versions with the same URI are compatible by definition.  Replacing a resource with a newer version of that resource MUST NOT break anything.  If a change violates this rule, then the URI of the resource (which serves as the major version) MUST be changed.  Plugins and extensions MUST adhere to at least the following rules:    * All versions of a plugin with a given URI MUST have the <q>same</q> set of     mandatory (not lv2:connectionOptional) ports with respect to lv2:symbol and     rdf:type.  In other words, every port on a particular version is guaranteed     to exist on a future version with same lv2:symbol and at least those     rdf:types.    * New ports MAY be added without changing the plugin URI if and only if they     are lv2:connectionOptional and the minor version is incremented.    * The minor version MUST be incremented if the index of any port (identified     by its symbol) is changed.    * All versions of a specification MUST be compatible in the sense that an     implementation of the new version can interoperate with an implementation     of any previous version.  Anything that depends on a specific version of a plugin (including referencing ports by index) MUST refer to the plugin by both URI and version.  However, implementations should be tolerant where possible.  When hosts discover several installed versions of a resource, they SHOULD warn the user and load only the most recent version.  An odd minor _or_ micro version, or minor version zero, indicates that the resource is a development version.  Hosts and tools SHOULD clearly indicate this wherever appropriate.  Minor version zero is a special case for pre-release development of plugins, or experimental plugins that are not intended for stable use at all.
