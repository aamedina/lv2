  "This is a vocabulary for parameters that are common in audio processing software.  A <q>parameter</q> is purely a metadata concept, unrelated to any particular code mechanism.  Parameters are used to assign meaning to controls (for example, using lv2:designation for ports) so they can be used more intelligently or presented to the user more efficiently."
