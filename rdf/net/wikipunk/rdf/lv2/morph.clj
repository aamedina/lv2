  "This extension defines two port types: morph:MorphPort, which has a host-configurable type, and morph:AutoMorphPort, which may automatically change type when a MorphPort's type is changed.  These ports always have a default type and work normally work in hosts that are unaware of this extension.  Thus, this extension provides a backwards compatibility mechanism which allows plugins to use new port types but gracefully fall back to a default type in hosts that do not support them.  This extension only defines port types and properties for describing morph ports.  The actual run-time switching is done via the opts:interface API."

(def AutoMorphPort
  "Ports of this type MUST have another type which defines the default buffer format (for example, lv2:ControlPort) but may dynamically change types based on the configured types of any morph:MorphPort ports on the same plugin instance.  The type of a port may only change in response to a host call to LV2_Options_Interface::set().  Whenever any port type on the instance changes, the host MUST check the type of all morph:AutoMorphPort ports with LV2_Options_Interface::get() before calling run() again, since they may have changed.  If the type of any port is zero, it means the current configuration is invalid and the plugin may not be run (unless that port is lv2:connectionOptional and connected to NULL).  This is mainly useful for outputs whose type depends on the type of corresponding inputs."
