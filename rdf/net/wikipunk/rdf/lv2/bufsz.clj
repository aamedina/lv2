  "This extension defines a facility for plugins to get information about the block length (the sample_count parameter of LV2_Descriptor::run) and port buffer sizes, as well as several features which can be used to restrict the block length.  This extension defines features and properties but has no special purpose API of its own.  The host provides all the relevant information to the plugin as [options](options.html).  To require restrictions on the block length, plugins can require additional features: bufsz:boundedBlockLength, bufsz:powerOf2BlockLength, and bufsz:fixedBlockLength.  These features are data-only, that is they merely indicate a restriction and do not carry any data or API."

  "A feature that indicates the host will provide both the bufsz:minBlockLength and bufsz:maxBlockLength options to the plugin.  Plugins that copy data from audio inputs can require this feature to ensure they know how much space is required for auxiliary buffers.  Note the minimum may be zero, this feature is mainly useful to ensure a maximum is available.  All hosts SHOULD support this feature, since it is simple to support and necessary for any plugins that may need to copy the input."

For example, plugins that do not implement sample-accurate control use this feature to indicate that the host should not split the run cycle because controls have changed.  Note that this feature is merely a hint, and does not guarantee a fixed block length.  The run cycle may be split for other reasons, and the blocksize itself may change anytime."

Plugins may use this length for optimization purposes, but MUST NOT assume the host will always process blocks of this length.  In particular, the host MAY process longer blocks."
