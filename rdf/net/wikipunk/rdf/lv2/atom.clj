  "An atom:Atom is a simple generic data container for holding any type of Plain Old Data (POD).  An Atom can contain simple primitive types like integers, floating point numbers, and strings; as well as structured data like lists and dictionary-like <q>Objects</q>.  Since Atoms are POD, they can be easily copied (for example, with `memcpy()`) anywhere and are suitable for use in real-time code.  Every atom starts with an LV2_Atom header, followed by the contents.  This allows code to process atoms without requiring special code for every type of data.  For example, plugins that mutually understand a type can be used together in a host that does not understand that type, because the host is only required to copy atoms, not interpret their contents.  Similarly, plugins (such as routers, delays, or data structures) can meaningfully process atoms of a type unknown to them.  Atoms should be used anywhere values of various types must be stored or transmitted.  An atom:AtomPort can be used to transmit atoms via ports.  An atom:AtomPort that contains a atom:Sequence can be used for sample accurate communication of events, such as MIDI.  ### Serialisation  Each Atom type defines a binary format for use at runtime, but also a serialisation that is natural to express in Turtle format.  Thus, this specification defines a powerful real-time appropriate data model, as well as a portable way to serialise any data in that model.  This is particularly useful for inter-process communication, saving/restoring state, and describing values in plugin data files.  ### Custom Atom Types  While it is possible to define new Atom types for any binary format, the standard types defined here are powerful enough to describe almost anything. Implementations SHOULD build structures out of the types provided here, rather than define new binary formats (for example, using atom:Object rather than a new C `struct` type).  Host and tool implementations have support for serialising all standard types, so new binary formats are an implementation burden which harms interoperabilty.  In particular, plugins SHOULD NOT expect UI communication or state saving with custom binary types to work.  In general, new Atom types should only be defined where absolutely necessary due to performance reasons and serialisation is not a concern."

  "An LV2_Atom has a 32-bit `size` and `type`, followed by a body of `size` bytes. Atoms MUST be 64-bit aligned.  All concrete Atom types (subclasses of this class) MUST define a precise binary layout for their body.  The `type` field is the URI of an Atom type mapped to an integer. Implementations SHOULD gracefully pass through, or ignore, atoms with unknown types.  All atoms are POD by definition except references, which as a special case have `type` 0.  An Atom MUST NOT contain a Reference.  It is safe to copy any non-reference Atom with a simple `memcpy`, even if the implementation does not understand `type`.  Though this extension reserves the type 0 for references, the details of reference handling are currently unspecified.  A future revision of this extension, or a different extension, may define how to use non-POD data and references.  Implementations MUST NOT send references to another implementation unless the receiver is explicitly known to support references (e.g. by supporting a feature).  The special case of a null atom with both `type` and `size` 0 is not considered a reference."

This will correctly handle the deprecated atom:Resource and atom:Blank types.

However, implementations may assume any binary Path (e.g. in an event payload) is a valid file path which can passed to system functions like fopen() directly, without any character encoding or escape expansion required.  Any implementation that creates a Path atom to transmit to another is responsible for ensuring it is valid.  A Path SHOULD always be absolute, unless there is some mechanism in place that defines a base path.  Since this is not the case for plugin instances, effectively any Path sent to or received from a plugin instance MUST be absolute."

The `context` field can be used to specify a different context for each property, where this is useful.  Otherwise, it may be 0.  Properties generally only exist as part of an atom:Object.  Accordingly, they will typically be represented directly as properties in RDF (see atom:Object).  If this is not possible, they may be expressed as partial reified statements, for example:      :::turtle     eg:someProperty         rdf:predicate eg:theKey ;         rdf:object eg:theValue ."
