  "This extension defines a feature, log:log, which allows plugins to print log messages with an API similar to the standard C `printf` function.  This allows, for example, plugin logs to be nicely presented to the user in a graphical user interface.  Different log levels are defined by URI and passed as an LV2_URID.  This extensions defines standard levels which are expected to be understood by all implementations and should be sufficient in most cases, but advanced implementations may define and use additional levels to suit their needs."
