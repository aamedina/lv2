  "This extension defines a feature, rsz:resize, which allows plugins to dynamically resize their output port buffers.  In addition to the dynamic feature, there are properties which describe the space required for a particular port buffer which can be used statically in data files."

(def asLargeAs
  "Indicates that a port requires at least as much buffer space as the port with the given symbol on the same plugin instance.  This may be used for any ports, but is generally most useful to indicate an output port must be at least as large as some input port (because it will copy from it).  If a port is asLargeAs several ports, it is asLargeAs the largest such port (not the sum of those ports' sizes).  The host guarantees that whenever an ObjectPort's run method is called, any output `O` that is rsz:asLargeAs an input `I` is connected to a buffer large enough to copy `I`, or `NULL` if the port is lv2:connectionOptional."
